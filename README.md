LightClock is a simple clock project.

#Hardware#
* [Arduino Uno R3](http://www.adafruit.com/products/50 "Arduino Uno R3")
* [LCD Shield](http://www.adafruit.com/products/714)
* NeoPixels Rings ([12](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1643), [24](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1586) and [60](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1768) LEDs)
* [Chronodot](http://www.adafruit.com/products/255)

#Chassis#
Made of smoke laser-cut acrylic. It's a very bad design that constantly falls appart and is a pain to assemble.

#Features#
* Displays the time (it's a clock!)
	* Minutes and Seconds on the outer ring
	* Hours (on the inner rings)
	* Date and Time on the LCD screen
* Time can be set with the buttons of the LCD shield.
* Keeps time even when not plugged thanks to the Chronodot battery

#In Progress#
(see other branches)
* PIR sensor to detect movement and light up/down
* Button to override PIR sensor

#Ideas for the future#
* Redesign chassis to be easier to assemble/disassemble and more sturdy.
* Alarm Clock (add a buzzer?)
* On/Off hours (dim or turn off at night)
* Add a potentiometer to control LEDs intensity
* Add some connectivity and a "Control app" to set things like colors and alarms.
